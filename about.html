        <p class="about-description"> I am Obed Tetteh Darko, the owner of this platform. I am a content and line editor and I take so much delight in whatever I do.
            I personally embarked on this initiative to help my friends correct some simple grammatical errors they make in their speaking and writing of English Language.
            GrammarGist remains the most patronised online English language platform, providing regular quintessential lessons on standard English usage, without charge.
